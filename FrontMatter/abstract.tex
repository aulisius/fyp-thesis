The overall goal in the field of compilers is to execute the computer programs as fast as possible. Like improvement in every existing methods we have, There exists improvement in compilers too, Which will make the execution of programs faster. This project will discuss various methods by which the execution of programs is made faster.

We chose to implement the improvement techniques in LLVM because, If implemented in a specific compiler which renders itâ€™s use to just a specific language in specific environment, LLVM is generic compiler backend, Which makes our improvement techniques reach more audience. Also LLVM compiler infrastructure, despite being one of the most popular compiler backends, does not apply any kind of loop optimization especially predictive commoning. Loop optimizations in LLVM compiler IR will result in eliminating significant number of memory accesses, resulting in faster code. This project will explore tweaks in second order predictive commoning to make these improvements possible.
